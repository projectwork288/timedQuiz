04 Web API - Timed Quiz

I feel like this is going to be a listing of what I could not figure out. I had a hard time with this assignment.

I was not able to figure out how to get only one question to present to the user at a time. All 10 questions are viewed sequencially at once.

I was able to manage a start button which initiated a visable 90 second timer and launched the questions.

For each question only 1 radio button was selectable as expected. You can't answer with more than one response.

If all of the questions is answered the user is presented with a "Finished with Questions" button which results in the number of correctly and incorrectly answered questions. 

The timer is cleared and the user is notified that the Quiz is ended when the 90 seconds is over.

I did not figure out how to subtract time for incorrect answers.
